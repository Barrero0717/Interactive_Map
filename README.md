# Interactive Map
_Customised and interactive map with Python‚Äôs Folium library and Pandas._

## üöÄ Getting Started  

_Folium is a python library allowing to call the Leaflet.js Javascript library. It allows you to manipulate your data with python and map them using the power of leaflet! It is really easy to call a map using this library. This app shows the map of Bogota, and includes important data of the city such as the delimitation of its localities, the immediate attention center of the Police, Fire stations and bike paths where bicycles can ride. The data is obtained from the page "Datos Abiertos Bogot√°"_. [See here](https://datosabiertos.bogota.gov.co/)

_For the web version, the Flask framework is used._
